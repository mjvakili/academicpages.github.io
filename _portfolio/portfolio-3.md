This is the problem I worked on with [Ross Fadely (Wall Street Journal)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossfadely) and 
[David W Hogg (NYU; Center for Data Science and Physics Department)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/david-hogg/).
Given the low resolution images of the HST in the crowded fields, how to we measure the 
shapes and the amount of light coming from the stars?
