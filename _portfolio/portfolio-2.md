In cosmology, the mathematical models describing the universe are constrained with Bayesian inference. 
The aim of Bayesian inference is to calculated the probability of model conditioned on the observed data.
This condistional probability, named posterior, can be fully determined (upto some prefactor) 
by the probability of the observed data conditioned on the model (known as the likelihood) and the 
prior probability over the parameters of the model.
