Luminous red galaxies are objects with old stellar populations that reside in regions of matter overdensity. 
These are very rare objects because they only form in the densest regions and they tend to cover large volumes 
of the universe. These objects are ideal candidates for understanding the large-scale structure.

With the [Kilo Degree Survey](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) we have images 1500 deg<sup>2</sup> of the sky in 9 filters.
