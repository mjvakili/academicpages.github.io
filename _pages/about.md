My name is Mohammadjavad Vakili. I'm a researcher working on data-driven and machine learning methods 
in order to extract insights from terabyte-sized cosmological datasets.

At Leiden Observatory, I am a member of two international teams: [KiDS](http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) and the [Euclid Consurtium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/). In August 2017, I moved to Leiden, in the Netherlands. 
Before that, I was a PhD researcher at New York University where I earned my PhD in Physics in the group of [David W. Hogg](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/david-hogg/) (Professor of Physics and Data Science at NYU).

My activities fall into two main category:

* Building machine learning pipelines for automated object detection and classification in multiband imaging data

* Testing and forecasting cosmological models with statsitical inference and deep learning.


<!--I work on extracting cosmological information from the complex terabyte-sized data sets such as multi-band images of the dark sky. I work in two international teams: the Euclid Survey (>1000 team members) and the Kilo Degree Survey (20 team members).
I develop and deploy models for getting the most of the unprecedented amount of data coming from these two large galaxy surveys.

I have been lucky to mentor talented master students on how to detect anomalies and irregularities in high dimensional galaxy survey data sets.

For a full list of my publications, take a look at [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FnlCPFEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Furthermore, I spend sometime in the Netherlands Red Cross where I work in the autmoated damage assessment team. We are building computer vision models to automatically assess damage in Satellite images for the purpose of boosting reposnse to 
natural disasters.

Feel free to take a look at a summary of my projects [Portfolio page](https://mjvakili.github.io/portfolio/) blog posts [Blog posts page](mjvakili.github.io/year-archive) the talks that I've given throughout my career [Talks page](https://mjvakili.github.io/talks).

<!--What do I do?
==========
Currently, I'm invovled in the upcoming Euclid Survey. Along with Eric Julo (Marsellei, France) I am leading the efforts to perform cosmological forecasts by combining the data from the VIS and Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instruments of the Euclid Satellite. We have shown that by cross-correlating the positions of H-alpha emitters from the NISP instriment and the cosmic shear estimated using the images from the VIS instrument, one can improve the constraints on cosmological models.
I'm also involved in the ongoing Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) where I have led a project on building a pipeline for detection of red-sequence objects from 9 band photometry of the KiDS-VIKING camera. This project has been done in close colaboration with researchers from Leiden Observatory (NL), Oxford (UK), Bonn (Germany). 
We have achieved percent-level errors in estimation of the distances of these objects. That has allowed us to leverage this catalog in predicting the distribution of dark matter through a joint clustering/lensing analysis. Several other projects have been initiated from our data products. 
Some examples are density-split statistics (led by Pierre Burger in Bonn and Joachim Harnois in Edinburgh) and intrinsic alignment (led by Maria Cristina Fortuna in Leiden).
In the Kilo Degree Survey, I am the convener of the randoms group, where we perform various quality insurance tests of the 
data such as the correlation of the detection rate of objects and various variables such as the distorations due to telescope optics. 
In the automated damage assessment team of the Red Cross, I am involved in developing semantic segmentation models for detecting the outlines of images, and predicting the level of damage in civilian areas after natural disasters.-->
