My name is Mohammadjavad Vakili. I'm a Data Scientist / Research assoicate working on generating insight from large datasets 
with statitical tools. At Leiden Observatory, I am a member of the Weak Lensing working group where I work closely with Henk Hoekstra.
 
In August 2017, I moved to the beautiful city of Leiden, in the Netherlands to start my position. 
Before that, I was a PhD researcher at New York University where I earned my PhD in Physics. 
My PhD advisor was David W. Hogg.

I'm mostly interested in developing and applying methods for better analyzing the data from the large scale galaxy surveys. 
Currently, I'm invovled in the upcoming Euclid Survey where I work on a joint galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering analysis. 
I'm also involved in the ongoing Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU) Survey.

I'm working on using deep learning and likelihood free inference to extract information from cosmological datasets.
