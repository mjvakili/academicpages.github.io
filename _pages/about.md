My name is Mohammadjavad Vakili. I'm a Postdoctoral research assoicate working in the weak lensing group 
at the Leiden Observatory where I work closely with Henk Hoekstra. 
In September 2018, I moved to the beautiful city of Leiden, in the Netherlands to start my Postdoc position. 
Before that, I was a graduate student researcher at New York University where I earned my PhD in Physics. 
My PhD advisor was David W. Hogg.

I'm mostly interested in observational cosmology and developing and applying methods for better analyzing 
the data from the large scale galaxy surveys. 
Currently, I'm invovled in the upcoming Euclid Survey where I work on a joint galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering analysis. 
I'm also involved in the ongoing Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU) Survey.
Furthermore, I'm working on using likelihood free inference and deep learning to extract information from 
cosmological simulations and datasets.
