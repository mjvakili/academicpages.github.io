My name is Mohammadjavad Vakili. I'm a Postdoctoral research assoicate working in the weak lensing group at the Leiden Observatory.
In September 2018, I moved to the beautiful city of Leiden, in the Netherlands to start my Postdoc position. 
Before that, I was a graduate student researcher at New York University where I earned my PhD in Physics.

I'm mostly interested in developing methods for better analyzing the data from the large scale galaxy surveys. 
Currently, I'm invovled in the upcoming Euclid Survey where I work on joint galaxy lensing and clustering analysis. 
I'm also involved in the ongoing Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Physics of the Accelerating Universe (PAU) Survey.
Furthermore, I'm working on using likelihood free inference and deep learning to extract information from the 
cosmological simulations and datasets.
