Named entity recognition (NER) is the practice of recognizing names in a given 
body of text and identifying the entity category associated with them: 
persons, locations, etc. 

Overview
=======

Model applied to the comment section of New York Times articles
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are many pretrained NER models in the literature. 
We make use of the spaCy [en_core_web_sm](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_sm) 
model. This model is a CNN model trained on the [OntoNotes data](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19). 
This CNN model carries out multiple tasks such as Part of the Speech Tag and recognition 
of named entities.

We use the New York Times API to fetch the comments of a given nytimes article 
whose link is provided by the user. Once the comments are feteched, we use the ```en_core_web_sm```
model to identify the named entities in all the comments. 


Sentiment 
--------------
Then we use a [rule-based sentiment analayzer](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) 
to find the sentiment polarity associated with the most common named entities 
mentioned in the comments.

Serving on a browser
=======

We use [streamlit](streamlit.io) to serve the model in an app that can be hosted on the browser.
Let's have a look at how the results look like:

In the example shown above, we see a comment in which three named entities are recognized: 
Action (a person), Ohio (GPE, a geographical location) and New York (GPE).

In the figure shown above, we see the distribution of sentiment scores associated 
with the named entity Acton in the comments. The scores are bounded between -1 and 1. The higher (lower) score 
values correspond to more positive (negative) sentiments.
