One of the chalenges of cosmological parameter estimation is marginalizing out 
the nuisance parameters such as the parameters that model the connection 
between galaxies and dark matter. For such marginalizations we are required 
to evaluate this conditional probability p(galaxy properties | dark matter halo properties).
The list of galaxy properties consists of stellar mass, star formation rate, etc 
and the list of dark matter halo properties consists of mass, maximum circular velocity, etc.

In order to evaluate these we can either use [parametrized empirical models](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf1a1) 
or [expensive hydrodynamic simulations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0127-2). The parametrized models 
are not physically motivated by they can be inserted in a cosmological inference setup. The hydro simulations 
are realistic and physically motivated but it is not tractable to include these inside a cosmological inference 
framework. 


We propose a solution for this problem by modeling the conditional probability p(galaxy properties | dark matter halo properties) 
with a mixture density network.

Mixture Density Network
=======

A [mixture denisty network](https://publications.aston.ac.uk/373/1/NCRG_94_004.pdf) models a conditional 
probability p(y|x) by a [Gaussian Mixture Model](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html) 
where the parameters of the mixture model are some nonlinear funcitons of x. This nonlinear function 
is given by a deep neural network:

At the bottom of the graphical model shown above we have the dark matter halo 
properties and at the top of the model we have the astrophysical parameters.  

Application to a complex hydrodynamic simulation
=======

We applied this model to [a realistic simulation of the universe](http://eagle.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) 
where a list of dark matter properties were passed as input to the model 
and a list of galaxy properties were passed as output to the model. 
The modern learns the probability distribution of galaxy properties 
conditioned on dark matter halo properties. Here is an example:

In the contour plot shown here, we see the joint probability distribution 
of the stellar mass of galaxies and the maximum circular velocity of 
dark matter halos. The empty(filled) contours correspond to 
the network prediction(simulation). 

We see that the mixture denisty networks provide a fast way of 
evaluating the hard-to-evaluate conditional probability inside 
our cosmological inferences.
