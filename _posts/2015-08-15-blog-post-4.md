Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning labels to different pixels in an image.
So you can think of it as a binary or multi-label classification.
That means the targets have the same size as their corresponding images.

In a typical tensorflow/Keras workflow in which we deal with a classification 
task the data are organized in the following format:

* train
  * labelA
    
    image1, image2, ...
  
  * labelB 

    image1, image2, ...

   * etc.

* validation
  * labelA
    
    image1, image2, ...
  
  * labelB 

    image1, image2, ...

   * etc.
 
* test
  * labelA
    
    image1, image2, ...
  
  * labelB 

    image1, image2, ...

   * etc.
    
During the training/validation/test steps images in batch are transformed on the fly 
via ```keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator``` which generates batches of transformed 
tensors:

```train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(...)```, ```valid_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(...)```

Then we use ```flow_from_directory``` to create ```train_generator```, ```valid_generator```.
