Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning labels to different pixels in an image.
So you can think of it as a binary or multi-label classification.
That means the targets have the same size as their corresponding images.

In a typical tensorflow/Keras workflow in which we deal with a classification 
task the data are organized in the following format:

* train
  * labelA
    
    image1, image2, ...
  
  * labelB 

    image1, image2, ...

   * etc.
